# Using flyway migration with a postgresql database

## What is flyway migration?

Flyway is an open-source database migration tool that helps manage changes to a database schema. It allows for version control of database schemas and makes it easy to migrate between versions. The tool supports SQL-based migrations and can be integrated into various build and deployment processes. The goal of Flyway is to make it easy to keep track of changes to the database schema and to ensure that all instances of the database have the same schema.
